##  Overview
This project explores Olympic Games data using structured SQL queries to extract insights on country performance, athlete achievements, and medal distributions.

##  Key Objectives
- Analyze medal counts by country and sport
- Identify top-performing athletes
- Examine trends over time (summer vs winter, team vs individual)
- Use SQL for exploration, aggregation, and filtering

##  Project Files
- `/sql/` – Contains query files like:
  - `medal_count_by_country.sql`

  - `performance_by_year.sql`
- `/data/` – Olympic dataset (if publicly sharable)
- `/assets/screenshots/` – Optional query output previews

## Tools & Skills Used
- SQL (MySQ)
- Joins, Aggregations, CTEs, Window Functions
- Data Cleaning and Exploration

##Use Cases
Great for BI analysts, sports data enthusiasts, and SQL practice. Can be extended into visual dashboards (e.g. Power BI or Tableau).
